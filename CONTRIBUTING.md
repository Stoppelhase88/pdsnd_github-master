# Contribution Guidelines

## Branching Strategy
- 'main' is a protected, stable base.
- Feature development to 'feature/<short description>'.
- Merges via pull request; use **Merge (no-ff)** if possible, rebase only locally for cleanup.

## Conventional Commits
Examples:
- 'feat(metrics): add average token estimate'
- 'fix(cli): handle empty files gracefully'
- 'test: increase coverage for token estimator'

## Code Style & Tests
- Python ≥ 3.9, 'pytest' for testing.
- CI (GitHub Actions) runs 'pytest -q'.

## PR checklist
- [x] Description & Motivation
